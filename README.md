## Nodewise

Nodewise is a web-application for [Baltimore Node](http://baltimorenode.org).

See our door project notes at:
[http://wiki.baltimorenode.org/index.php?title=RFID_door_lock](http://wiki.baltimorenode.org/index.php?title=RFID_door_lock).

This project is inspired in part by [the Open Door
Hackathon](http://opendoor.eventbrite.com/), but is not intended as serious
competion.

## Hacking

You'll need ruby, at least 1.8.7. I'd also highly recommend [rvm](). 

Once you've downloaded the source, run `bundle install` and `cp
config/database.local.yml config/database.yml`.

Once those are finished, you should be able to run the tests and a 
local server.

## License

Just Use It.
